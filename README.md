# DualExport

DualExport is a Cadwork 3D plugin that exports a 2D container shop drawing and a piece-by-piece shop drawing of the elements assigned to the container.

## Installation

Clone in `API.x64` folder of 3D.

```bash
cd 'c:\users\public\documents\cadwork\userprofil_27\API.x64'
git clone https://github.com/CadworkMontreal/DualExport.git
```

## Usage

Activate containers to be exported. Number of exported clipboards will be displayed at the end. The clipboards can be pasted in 2D as `1-n` to paste in one command.
